🧪 Step 1: Test System Health
First, let's verify everything is working:
bash# Check system health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# You should see something like:
# {
#   "status": "healthy",
#   "service": "devops-autocoder", 
#   "langgraph_available": true,
#   "todo_app": {
#     "frontend": true,
#     "backend": true
#   }
# }
🚀 Step 2: Test Automated Export Feature
This will automatically generate an export button and update your Todo app:
bash# Test export functionality automation
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/test/export

# Expected response:
# {
#   "test": "export_functionality",
#   "trace_id": "abc-123-def",
#   "files_generated": 3,
#   "files_written": 3,
#   "success": true
# }
What this does:

✅ Generates ExportButton.jsx component
✅ Updates App.jsx with export functionality
✅ Updates App.css with export styling
✅ Writes files to your filesystem
✅ Triggers hot reload

🔍 Step 3: Test Automated Search Feature
This will add real-time search functionality:
bash# Test search functionality automation
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/test/search

# Expected response:
# {
#   "test": "search_functionality", 
#   "trace_id": "xyz-456-ghi",
#   "files_generated": 3,
#   "files_written": 3,
#   "success": true
# }
What this does:

✅ Generates SearchBar.jsx component
✅ Updates App.jsx with search functionality
✅ Updates App.css with search styling
✅ Adds real-time filtering

📊 Step 5: Monitor the Automation Process
bash# View recent logs
curl http://localhost:8000/logs?lines=50

# Check generated files
curl http://localhost:8000/files

# View backup files created
curl http://localhost:8000/backups
🎭 Step 6: Send Custom Automation Requests
Try creating your own automation requests:
bash# Custom notification system
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/webhook/jira \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Hub-Signature-256: sha256=test" \
  -d '{
    "issue": {
      "key": "CUSTOM-001",
      "fields": {
        "summary": "Add notification system with due dates",
        "issuetype": {"name": "Story"},
        "description": "Add notification badges and due date alerts for todos with priority indicators"
      }
    }
  }'

# Custom styling improvements
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/webhook/jira \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Hub-Signature-256: sha256=test" \
  -d '{
    "issue": {
      "key": "STYLE-002", 
      "fields": {
        "summary": "Enhance todo priority colors",
        "issuetype": {"name": "Bug"},
        "description": "Update priority color scheme: high priority red, medium yellow, low green with better contrast"
      }
    }
  }'
📈 Step 7: Check Processing Status
bash# Check status of your custom requests
curl http://localhost:8000/status/CUSTOM-001
curl http://localhost:8000/status/STYLE-002

# Download generated reports
curl http://localhost:8000/reports/CUSTOM-001 -o custom-001-report.md
🔧 Step 8: Run Comprehensive Tests
bash# Run the test script (if you created it)
./test-system.sh

# Or test manually:
echo "Testing all endpoints..."
curl http://localhost:8000/health && echo "✅ Health OK"
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/test/export && echo "✅ Export OK" 
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/test/search && echo "✅ Search OK"
curl http://localhost:8000/files && echo "✅ Files OK"
🎉 Expected Results
After running these tests, you should see:

In your Todo app (http://localhost:3000):

📤 Export button that downloads CSV files
🔍 Search bar with real-time filtering
🎨 Enhanced visual styling
⚡ All changes appear automatically (hot reload)


In your file system:

todo-app/frontend/src/components/ExportButton.jsx
todo-app/frontend/src/components/SearchBar.jsx
Updated todo-app/frontend/src/App.jsx
Updated todo-app/frontend/src/App.css
Backup files in backups/ directory
Reports in reports/ directory


In the logs:

Success/error messages



🚨 If Something Goes Wrong
bash# Check for errors
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# View recent errors in logs
curl http://localhost:8000/logs | grep -i error

# Clean up if needed
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/cleanup
